This is a little personal project of mine, intended to set up and configure an fresh installation of Windows to my liking. It is NOT designed as a portable tool for othersâ€”I'm sharing this just to show off what I've made and potentially to help anyone who finds it a useful reference. Use it as you like but don't expect it to do exactly what you want out of the box.

The script is designed to run on Windows 11 version 24H2, on an en-GB ISO and the region set to Germany in OOBE (for Edge).

Special thanks to the PowerShell Discord server for helping me figure this all out, as well as a few folks on the WinAdmins Discord who helped me troubleshoot language installation, among other things. Also big shoutout to [jborean's ProcessEx module](https://github.com/jborean93/ProcessEx/), which was instrumental in pulling off the arcane wizardry needed to remove Edge programmatically (definitely the most fun puzzle to solve in all this!).
